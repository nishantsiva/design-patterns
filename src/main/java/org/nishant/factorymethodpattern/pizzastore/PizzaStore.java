     * Factory Method
     * <p>
     * The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
     * for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
     * class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
     * instantiation to subclasses.
     * <p>
     * Use Factory Method to
     * decouple our client code from the concrete classes we
     * need to instantiate, or if we donâ€™t know ahead of time
     * all the concrete classes we are going to need. To use Factory Method,
     * just subclass it and implement its factory method!
